Side Menu in CSS

This project is a responsive, hover-expandable side menu designed using HTML and CSS. The menu provides a compact sidebar that expands on hover to reveal navigation items with icons and text.

Features

    Compact Sidebar Design: The sidebar is narrow by default but expands when hovered, creating an interactive experience without taking up too much screen space.
    Simple & Responsive: Built entirely with HTML and CSS, this layout is lightweight and adaptable.
    Customizable: Easily change colors, icons, or text within the CSS and HTML.
